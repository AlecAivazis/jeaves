# Jeeves

A discord bot for your Classic WoW guild.

NOTE: none of this is implemented... yet

## Introduction

Every guild has a Discord channel that acts as the hub for the community. Unforunately,
Discord is missing a lot of features that any self-respecting guild requires to function.
Jeeves understands that you don't want to split your guild's attention between Discord
and a clunky website. To help with this, he provides a number of different services
for your guild including:

- Guild Bank

## Guild Bank

### Setup

Before Jeeves can track your guild bank's contents, you must tell him where he can display what is
inside of your bank. To do this, say `!jeeves-assign-bank` inside of the desired channel.
Once you see a confirmation from Jeeves, we reccomend deleting the messages that accumulated
during setup to keep things tidy.
